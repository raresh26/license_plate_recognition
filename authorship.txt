1. Localization part(50%) - implemented color segmentation method, plate coordinates getter and validity check for them and plate rotation.
2. Recognition part(40%) - implemented the evaluation for Recognition, character recognition using XOR method and final license plate string construction
3. Capture Frame process(60%) - implemented the input video frame by frame split and plate localization and recognition in each one of them, the similar plates grouping
			   and majority voting along with Dutch validity check to decide which is the final output for the given plate.

Project contribution - 50%
1. Localization part(50%) - Implemented evaluation for localization: formatting rectangle coordinates from our ground truth, calculating intersection over union, calculating final score.
2. Recognition part(60%) - Implemented character segmentation: preprocessing the cropped input plate, implementing flood-fill, finding the characters that make up the image.
3. Capture Frame process(40%) - Implemented optimizations: profiled the pipeline, optimized methods in Recognize.py with numpy operations instead of for loops.
